# Example of Vite with deployment on GitHub Pages

We need to configure the _deploy.sh_ file and create the script to deploy in packag.json. After that we need to rebuild the application with

```
yarn build
```

Then in our Github pages we go to _Settings > Pages_ and we'll be able to see the URL of our successfully deployed application in GitHub Pages.
